# Escape Reality - Chatbot Escape Room

Development of a dystopian chatbot escape room game on the topic of climate change as a group project. This was part of the master module “Study Project Quality & Usability” at the TU berlin.
Created with Python and rasa.

What you need to set up:
```
conda create --name rasa3 python=3.9
```
```
activate rasa3
```
```
pip install rasa
```
```
rasa init
```
Test the code and talk to the slightly cynical chatbot:
```
rasa shell
```
