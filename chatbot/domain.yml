  utter_start:
  - text: "You slowly open your eyes and look around the room you found yourself in. Glaring light from the ceiling blinds you as you notice that you are in a lab. Suddenly, panic grips you as you notice that the room is slowly filling with water. With no time to waste, you look around to find a way out. You notice a bed, a desk, a bookshelf, a window and a door. Which one do you want to examine?"

  utter_game_over:
  - text: "You take the antenna and put it back on the climate machine. The machine starts working again and prompts you to configure its settings. As you already did these settings so many times in the past, you are able to start up the program to immediately start to reverse the effects of climate change. You look out the window at the melting icebergs hoping it is not too late and that they stop melting ... but they don't. You suddenly realise you can't stop climate change anymore. The point of no return has been already reached ...If you, dear player, want to do something about climate change now before it's too late, this website from the United Nations is a good place to start to gather information: https://www.un.org/en/actnow/ten-actions - thanks for playing! Hope you enjoyed! :)"
